    <p>
      As renewable energy adoption grows, homeowners and businesses in
      <strong>Kottayam</strong> are increasingly choosing solar power systems to
      cut electricity bills and reduce dependence on the grid. However, solar
      systems require regular maintenance and monitoring to ensure long-term
      performance, efficiency, and return on investment.
    </p>

    <p>
      At <strong>Solar Assist</strong>, we offer a full suite of solar power
      system services — from scheduled maintenance and panel cleaning to
      advanced inverter troubleshooting, online monitoring support, and expert
      solar consultation. Our team of certified technicians is experienced
      with both residential and commercial solar installations in Kottayam,
      including on-grid, off-grid and hybrid systems.

    <h2 class="section-title">Solar System Maintenance & AMC Services</h2>

    <p>
      Solar maintenance in Kottayam is essential to preserve the output and
      efficiency of your solar panels. Without routine checks, dirt, debris,
      electrical wear, or faulty components can reduce energy generation and
      lead to system malfunction.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our <strong>Annual Maintenance Contract (AMC)</strong> plans are designed
      to provide regular inspections, preventive maintenance, performance
      optimization, and priority support. With years of experience in solar
      maintenance across Kerala, we help you maximize energy production while
      minimizing breakdowns and unexpected costs. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
    </p>

    <h3>What’s Included in AMC</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Scheduled system inspection & performance analysis</li>
      <li>Cleaning of panels for optimal efficiency</li>
      <li>Inverter, cable & connector maintenance</li>
      <li>Online performance monitoring & reporting</li>
      <li>Priority response for any issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Regular maintenance not only keeps your solar system running efficiently
      but also extends its life significantly, often beyond 25+ years when
      properly maintained. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

    <h2 class="section-title">Solar Panel Cleaning in Kottayam</h2>

    <p>
      Accumulation of dust, bird droppings, pollen, and fingerprints can
      significantly reduce the performance of solar PV systems. Even a thin
      layer of dirt can block sunlight, reducing energy production by up to
      20-25%. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Solar Assist</strong> offers professional solar panel cleaning
      services across Kottayam, using safe methods that protect your panel
      surfaces and improve output. Whether you need periodic cleaning for your
      home system or a regular schedule for commercial arrays, our team has
      the expertise and tools to do it efficiently.
    </p>

    <h3>Our Cleaning Process</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Initial visual inspection of panels</li>
      <li>Gentle cleaning with filtered/soft water</li>
      <li>Removal of debris without harsh chemicals</li>
      <li>Dry wipe to prevent water stains</li>
      <li>Post-cleaning output check</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Regular panel cleaning can help increase solar generation by preserving
      the surface efficiency of photovoltaic cells and ensuring maximum energy
      production even in Kerala’s tropical climate. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

<!-- ===== INVERTER REPAIR & TROUBLESHOOTING ===== -->
<section class="section-padding bg-light">
  <div class="container">

    <h2 class="section-title">Solar Inverter Repair & Troubleshooting</h2>

    <p>
      The inverter is the heart of your solar system — it converts DC power
      from PV panels into usable AC power for your home or business. When the
      inverter malfunctions, your system may stop generating electricity,
      display error codes, or work inefficiently.
    </p>

    <p>
      We service most popular solar inverter brands and troubleshoot issues
      such as error codes, grid mismatch, system shutdown, low voltage, fan
      failure, or firmware issues. Our technicians are trained to diagnose
      problems quickly and restore your system to optimal operation.
    </p>

    <h3>Common Inverter Issues</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Grid/Earth fault errors</li>
      <li>Communication failure with monitoring systems</li>
      <li>Low power output errors</li>
      <li>Overheating or fan issues</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Inverter repair and maintenance services ensure uninterrupted solar
      performance and prevent costly downtime — critical for homes and
      commercial setups alike.

    <p>
      Modern solar systems offer online monitoring and performance tracking
      through mobile apps and portals. However, setup issues, login errors,
      data discrepancies, or alerts can confuse many system owners.
    </p>

      you:
